Title - Leading business sustainability trends in 2024 that are shaping the future
Year – April 30, 2024
The article describes trends in business sustainability in 2024. The strategies include circular economy models, ESG criteria to promote transparency, and utilizing the principles of management of Scope 3 emissions. Responsible and circular supply chain management are growing trends and regenerative agriculture practices are also being implemented increasingly while digital technologies such as AI and blockchain are being used in sustainability performances. Companies are also considering employee's mental health, welfare, climate adaptability, and the proper handling and management of the living world. Sustainability considerations are increasingly finding their way into the corporate strategy, through sustainable finance and comprehensive sustainability reporting.

Potential Applications-
Mobilinq can leverage these trends to enhance its business operations. Below are some practical applications relevant to our organization:
1.	Recycling Management - Mobilinq can research on how to effectively refurbish and recycle our products to decrease the levels of waste while increasing the usefulness of phones and other accessories.
2.	Sustainable supply chain – Mobilinq can adopt a sustainable supply chain for their smartphones, accessories, and other products which can strengthen the credibility of the company and attract environmentally aware customers.
3.	Exploring digital sustainability - AI can help our company maintain stock by checking out sales data and determining what needs to be restocked. They also can reorder the inventories when the stock is low and does not need manual input with which the company should not be stocking too much of something or at times lacking some essential products.

Recommendations-
Based on the trends and potential applications, the following steps are recommended for Mobilinq:
1.	Adopt Sustainable sourcing – Mobilinq can implement the sourcing of environmentally friendly parts of the smartphone and its accessories. Moreover, it will also encourage the brand image of the company and fulfill the consumer demand who are now more concern with environment-friendly products.
2.	Optimizing Inventory with AI – By exploring AI, it can be very helpful to improve stock management due to an accurate forecast of the demand for various products, with auto-reorders once they reach the critical low level. This will help in reducing the inventory over stock which leads to reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of the business.
3.	Sustainable supply chain system – Mobilinq can deal with those suppliers who give preferences to eco-friendly products while ordering the inventory which will help to improve the supply chain sustainably.

Dear Investor,
It is my pleasure to introduce the Mobilinq Expansion and Upgrade Initiative, a strategic project that will ensure that Mobilinq improves its brand and increases the company’s operational capacity as it seeks to align more with the core value of sustainability. As the market need for affordable, reliable, sustainable mobile repair services grows, Mobilinq has every opportunity to capture a larger share of this market. This project will open three more store locations that will expose many more clients to our services and thus improve our brand presence as it seeks to meet the growing population’s diverse needs in Victoria and beyond.
This proposal has been anchored on Mobilinq’s sustainability policy. In the mobile repair services provided, we make conscious efforts to manage and counter e-waste, a global problem, with the services we provide to our customers. These proposed expansions will allow us to become more efficient in meeting the needs of the community while staying true to our mission of offering environmentally, friendly quality repairs at unbeatable customer service.
The provision of the $200,000 requested would be used to pay for the lease on the new locations and to renovate them, equipment installation, inventory purchase, and appropriate advertisement to gain name recognition and to attract customers. This investment will enable us to satisfy customer demands, boost the company’s revenues and at the same time come up with ways that would help to enhance the sustainability of the environment.
Together with your help, I am sure that this initiative will bring considerable changes in growth rates, enhanced positions on the market, and new perspectives for further development and creation of new good users’ experiences investment opportunities at Mobilinq. Thank you for taking your time to read this proposal, I would be glad to clarify any doubts that you may have on this proposal on a one-on-one basis.

Sincerely,
Jatin Jain
Business Development Manager, Mobilinq

Executive Summary
Mobilinq Store requires $200,000 in order to improve and develop the store to add three more stores in Victoria, BC where there is a strong demand for environmentally friendly mobile repair outlets. That is why this initiative plans to enhance brand awareness, availability, and contribution to society by providing high-quality repairs, device accessories, supporting the decrease of e-waste production.

The funding will go towards leasing costs, store modifications, equipment installation, inventory procurement, and marketing for stores. This means that the entire project execution plan shall take 6 months with phased site selection and set up and marketing activities to ensure that the website attracts a pool of customers. The critical risks of competition and the delay in setting up plans have been managed by selecting proper sites, partnering with other organizations and considering back up plans.

Consumers will be satisfied, revenue will be driven up, and Mobilinq will be validated as a profitable and responsible choice for community-based mobile repair. Granting this request will help Mobilinq to provide quality, cheap services, hence benefiting both Mobilinq and the members of the community.

Introduction
Background:
Mobilinq is a young enterprise created in 2014 (Mobilinq, n.d.-b), However, through rendering high standard mobile repair services at a very reasonable price it has gained a strong reputation (Mobilinq, n.d.-b). In the ever-increasing market of clients seeking sustainable repair solutions, the growth of Mobilinq is essential to increase market share and proving initiative to environmentally friendly solutions (Mobilinq, n.d.-b).

Problem Statement:
Mobilinq’s target market is motivated by the growing need for mobile repair shops in easily accessible areas with higher traffic rates. However, the current limited number of stores diminishes our chances of catering to this growing customer base and missing out on potential revenue, as well as lower market exposure. It is crucial to expand to new outlets in order to meet this demand adequately and in a way that best relates to our mission of being both sustainable and affordable. With expansion to more customers, we can also encourage repair services to combat e-waste issues, provide employment for our people, and increase the sense of social responsibility that we hold as a company, thus aiming to ensure long-term company development and enhancement of community quality.
Purpose:
The aim of this project involves making new recommendations for the expansion of store outlets from 2 to 4 and installing the latest technology in its physical outlets.

Analysis
Smartphones have changed the world in a remarkably brief time frame (UnivDatos Market Insights, 2024). Today, globally, thirty percent of inhabitants engage in smartphone usage, and more than 370 billion USD is spent on new smartphone hardware annually (UnivDatos Market Insights, 2024). This is because there is constantly more reliance on smartphones and because affordable smartphones are currently available, the global average smartphone replacement time has been lowered to 21 months (UnivDatos Market Insights, 2024). The customers from the emerging market are more actively upgrading their smartphones than the developed economy (UnivDatos Market Insights, 2024). As increasingly more Chinese brands come into the market with products of higher specification at cheaper price, therefore, the upgrade frequency has been faster (UnivDatos Market Insights, 2024). Moreover, increasing trends in the usage of used and refurbished smartphones are also promoting this trend (UnivDatos Market Insights, 2024).

The Environmental Impact of E-Waste:
The world is already struggling with the problem of e-waste — in 2017 the metric tonnage reached 50 million units, and the United Nations believe it will increase by 21% by 2030 (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Smartphones account for this increasing amount largely since instead of being repaired, they are replaced (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

The disposal is a huge problem and poses several environmental risks for society (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Most electronics gadgets are packed with dangerous chemicals including lead, mercury and cadmium that may pollute soil and water system and be hazardous to human health and wildlife (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). By opting to use mobile repairs instead of getting new ones this step can go a long way in the fight against this particular kind of waste, in fact they harm the environment (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

Prolonging the Life of a Mobile Phone:
The first significant advantage of mobile repair is that it keeps a device in use for a longer period (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). When a smartphone is repaired then the equipment can work again without having to buy a new one (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). This strategy goes along the way of saving consumer cash and also conserves the parts needed for making new phone sets (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

The extraction of rare minerals and metals for making Smartphones has caused destruction of the environment and is a depleting process (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). The consequences of mining materials including cobalt, lithium, and gold involve habitat destruction, pollution as well as carbon emissions (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Mobile repair, instead of purchasing more gadgets will lead to less new devices circulation, and logically, fewer negative impacts rooted in raw materials extraction and processing (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

Reducing Carbon Footprint:
A mobile phone's carbon footprint represents the emissions produced throughout its life cycle that include production and distribution of all the ways to use and disposal (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Whereas it is possible to estimate that the carbon footprint associated with the lifecycle of a specific smartphone is about 60 kg carbon equivalent (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). 

Production is most carbon sensitive in the creation of new devices, where large energy consumption is essential, and CO2 emissions are grossly inflated (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). On the other hand, the overall carbon imprint tied with phone repair is negligible: In other words, mobile repair contributes only a fraction of that amount – only one tenth of emissions related to manufacturing of new devices (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). When choosing to have their mobile devices repaired, the consumer has a perfect opportunity of contributing towards the sustainable future of the world (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

Promoting Sustainable Practices in Mobile Repair Industry:
The mobile repair industry could be one of the biggest advocates for sustainability. Perhaps in its operation the mobile repair shops could adopt techniques to make the operation environmentally friendly thus reducing its impact to the world (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). One way is to make the repairs in a manner that will reduce the energy used in the process and this will go a long way (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

Also there are improved measures on the way that most mobile repair shops are disposing of most of their repaired handsets (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). This means that reused or scrap parts and toxic waste are disposed of with a lot of precautions. In the above sustainable practices, mobile repair firms try to save the future of the earth for us (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

Empowerment and Education:
The main actor in promoting sustainability in the mobile repair industry is the consumers (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). When consumers decide to repair rather than recycle their products, they will only tell manufacturers that people are concerned with sustainable business (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).
Members of consumer society need to increase their awareness of their decisions and of their consequences for the natural environment (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Who is aware of what effects e-waste has to bring or how helpful mobile repair can be today? The fact of the matter is that the more people are informed through workshops, informational campaigns or social media about the processes happening in the mobile repair industry, the more they will be able to make conscious choices (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

This is an outright fact that a consumer who will be faced with the results of his purchasing decision on the environment will always be guaranteed to make wiser and rational decisions (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). For instance, before making one’s decision to purchase even the finest brand of an automobile or the latest model of a mobile phone, one should ask himself or herself the question whether this model’s current model cannot be repaired (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). This would probably help a lot of devices avoid becoming e-waste and make technology a little more environmentally friendly (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

The Role of Legislation in Mobile Repair and Sustainability:
Other legislation can also inspire the approach toward mobile repair and sustainability (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Such formations as the Right to Repair fight for the consumer’s right to repair a product without having to be forced to work with a specific repair center that is accredited by the manufacturer (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). Such laws give cheap and convenient ways of repairing electronics and there is much to gain for the empowered consumer (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

In addition, the government should be pushing, for example, policies that support sustainable electronics in mobile repair services to encourage people to repair and reuse electronic products (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024). When laws and policies supportive of a repair culture were to be passed, they would lend a hand in helping the industry to realize growth paths that are observed in other areas while moving forward, the ambitious sustainability goals of the technologies’ manufacturers (Dotsmarttechnologies, 2024).

Consequences Of Not Solving the Problem
If Mobilinq does not move forward with expansion, our market share and revenue growth will decrease, and so our competitiveness will be constrained. These scenarios limit the accessibility of our customers to our products, leaving them to be served by our competitors, hence cutting out a lot of sales and potential growth. This also means that the level of our contribution to environmental sustainability is limited because fewer clients use our repair services, consequently, the demand for electronic waste repair is not as high. In addition, without the ability to scale our operations, Mobilinq will be unable to effectively attract and hold on to the best talent – those competitors may seem more vibrant than Mobilinq, with new positions opening as they grow. In the end, these limitations will collide with growth that will prevent us from forming better relationships with the communities and adding value to the local economies. These would threaten our future sustainability and put us at risk of becoming less relevant in the ever-evolving and more competitive environment we are operating in with our products and services’ assistance and provision we can help more people and have a longer-lasting overall positive impact.

Alternative Solutions:
Option 1 - Open Three New Stores:
Pros: As such the benefits include greater access, brand awareness, and more customers sold.
Cons: Some of the disadvantages are increased initial investment with more resource utilization.

Option 2 - Online Service Expansion Only:
Pros: Less overhead, Versatility.
Cons: Low efficiency in identifying in-person, non-scheduled or walk-in customers.

Recommended Solution:
Opening three stores can provide a good opportunity to maximize the availability of brand association and brand identification and a high probability of both the commercial and social profits. This solution meets the relevant objectives of Mobilinq’s sustainability and indicates improved revenue growth and customer satisfaction.
