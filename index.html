Title - Leading business sustainability trends in 2024 that are shaping the future
Year – April 30, 2024
The article describes trends in business sustainability in 2024. The strategies include circular economy models, ESG criteria to promote transparency, and utilizing the principles of management of Scope 3 emissions. Responsible and circular supply chain management are growing trends and regenerative agriculture practices are also being implemented increasingly while digital technologies such as AI and blockchain are being used in sustainability performances. Companies are also considering employee's mental health, welfare, climate adaptability, and the proper handling and management of the living world. Sustainability considerations are increasingly finding their way into the corporate strategy, through sustainable finance and comprehensive sustainability reporting.

Potential Applications-
Mobilinq can leverage these trends to enhance its business operations. Below are some practical applications relevant to our organization:
1.	Recycling Management - Mobilinq can research on how to effectively refurbish and recycle our products to decrease the levels of waste while increasing the usefulness of phones and other accessories.
2.	Sustainable supply chain – Mobilinq can adopt a sustainable supply chain for their smartphones, accessories, and other products which can strengthen the credibility of the company and attract environmentally aware customers.
3.	Exploring digital sustainability - AI can help our company maintain stock by checking out sales data and determining what needs to be restocked. They also can reorder the inventories when the stock is low and does not need manual input with which the company should not be stocking too much of something or at times lacking some essential products.

Recommendations-
Based on the trends and potential applications, the following steps are recommended for Mobilinq:
1.	Adopt Sustainable sourcing – Mobilinq can implement the sourcing of environmentally friendly parts of the smartphone and its accessories. Moreover, it will also encourage the brand image of the company and fulfill the consumer demand who are now more concern with environment-friendly products.
2.	Optimizing Inventory with AI – By exploring AI, it can be very helpful to improve stock management due to an accurate forecast of the demand for various products, with auto-reorders once they reach the critical low level. This will help in reducing the inventory over stock which leads to reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of the business.
3.	Sustainable supply chain system – Mobilinq can deal with those suppliers who give preferences to eco-friendly products while ordering the inventory which will help to improve the supply chain sustainably.
